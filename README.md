# sms2mk3

Play your US Sega Master System games on a Japanese console. The compact design of the board reduces its cost and allows for more flexibility in mounting compared to other options on the market.

The sms2mk3 has the correct vertical size to fit inside a Sega Mark III or Japanese SMS cartridge. It was initially designed to re-use a Japanese Mark III cartridge as housing for a first-generation (legacy) Krikzz Master Everdrive. The design has been tested and confirmed to work for this use case.

Due to the recessed backs of these cartrdiges, case cutting may be necessary to fit the cartrdige slot. Alternatively, you can use a quick-solder board to permanently affix your US cartridge to the converter board, and you will be able to fit it all inside a Japanese Sega cartridge without external case cuts.
