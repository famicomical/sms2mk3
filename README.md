# sms2mk3

Play your US Sega Master System games on a Japanese console. 
The compact design of this board reduces its cost and allows for more flexibility in mounting compared to other options on the market.

The sms2mk3 has the correct vertical size to fit inside a Sega Mark III or Japanese SMS cartridge. It was initially designed to re-use a Japanese Mark III cartridge as housing for a first-generation (legacy) Krikzz Master Everdrive. The design has been tested and confirmed to work for this use case.

Due to the recessed backs of these cartrdiges, case cutting may be necessary to fit the cartrdige slot. Alternatively, you can use the quick-solder board to permanently affix your US cartridge to the converter board, and you will be able to fit it all inside a Japanese Sega cartridge without external case cuts.

## moving forward

This project would most effectively be used in conjunction with a newly manufactured plastic shell with the mounting extrusions correctly aligned with the screw holes on the US Master System cartridges. This would allow for a direct fit of the game and converter PCB assembly inside the housing. 3D modeling of the shell remains a further challenge yet to be solved.
